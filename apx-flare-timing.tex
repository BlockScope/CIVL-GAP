The \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing}{flare-timing}
implementation of GAP is a collection of apps, one for each step of the scoring
process. Not being a single app that can store intermediate results in memory,
its workings and final results are written to file. These \texttt{*.yaml} and
\texttt{*.csv} files can be checked by hand.
