The \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing}{flare-timing}
implementation of GAP is a collection of apps, one for each step of the scoring
process, see Fig~\ref{fig:flare-timing}. Not being a single app that can store
intermediate results in memory, its workings and final results are written to
file with enough detail and evidence so that everything can be checked by hand.

\subsection{Scoring Sequence of Steps}

    {\color{csv}\texttt{*.csv}} or \texttt{*.yaml} outputs.}
    \label{fig:flare-timing}
\end{figure}

Starting with an \texttt{*.fsdb} comp and related \texttt{*.igc} or
\texttt{*.kml} track logs, the scoring process proceeds in the following
sequence of steps;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Extract the inputs with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/extract-input}{extract-input}.
    \item
        Trace the route of the shortest path to fly a task with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/task-length}{task-length}.
    \item
        Find pairs of fixes crossing over zones with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/cross-zone}{cross-zone}.
    \item
        Interpolate between crossing fixes for the time and place where a track
        tags a zone with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/tag-zone}{tag-zone}.
    \item
        Index fixes from the time of first crossing with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/align-time}{align-time}.
    \item
        Discard fixes that get further from goal and note leading area with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/discard-further}{discard-further}.
    \item
        Mask a task over its tracklogs with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/mask-track}{mask-track}.
    \item
        Group and count land outs with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/land-out}{land-out}.
    \item
        Score the competition with
        \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing/tree/master/flare-timing/prod-apps/gap-point}{gap-point}.  
\end{enumerate}
