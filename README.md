# CIVL-GAP

This is an experiment to see if I can reproduce the CIVL GAP scoring docs,
starting from LaTeX markup.

LaTeX has markup for equations and charts. Its plain-text source works in well
with source control and related tooling.

GAP scoring is well documented.  Currently, the source format is *.docx and it
is published as a single *.pdf file, [Sporting Code Section 7A - Annex
GAP](https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/documents/sporting_code_s7a-xc-civl_gap_annex_1.pdf),
running to about fify pages with very many equations and quite a few charts.

Scoring is not simple. Hang-gliding and paragliding are scored similarly but
there are quite a few differences. Over the years scoring has evolved and it is
getting more complex. I'm not sure about this but I expect that only the latest
rules are documented.

Some of the documentation has surely been written about after being implemented
and some of what is implemented has no documentation. There are places where
readers are advised to consult the code and warned that the code differs from
the rules or worse yet that we're not sure what the code does exactly.

Having the documentation in LaTeX could help.  A contributor finding an issue
could reference and highlight a line number range in the source. Authors could
work at the same time on different parts of it without having conflicts and if
their contributions do overlap then there is merge tooling for resolving
conflicts.  Version history, differences, tagged versions and published
releases are also available.
