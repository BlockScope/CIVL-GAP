readers are advised to consult the code or warned that the code differs from
the rules or worse yet that we're not sure what the code does exactly.

The source format is *.docx and the published format is *.pdf.  This is an
experiment to see if I can reproduce the docs, starting in LaTeX. The reasons
for trying this are;
