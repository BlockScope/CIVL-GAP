# CIVL-GAP

GAP scoring is well documented. There many equations, many charts and quite
a lot of description, the document running to about fifty pages. Scoring is not
simple. Hang-gliding and paragliding are scored similarly but there are quite
a few differences. Over the years scoring has evolved and it is getting more
complex. I'm not sure about this but I expect that only the latest rules are
documented.

Some of the documentation has surely been written about after being implemented
and some of what is implemented has no documentation. There are places where
readers are advised to consult the code and warned that the code differs from
the rules or worse yet that we're not sure what the code does exactly.

The current source format is *.docx and the published format is *.pdf.

This is an experiment to see if I can reproduce the docs, starting in LaTeX.

LaTeX has markup for equations and charts. Its plain-text source works in well
with source control and related tooling. For instance an issue might reference
and highlight a line number range in the source, authors can work at the same
time on different parts of it without having conflicts and if their
contributions do overlap then there is merge tooling for resolving conflicts.
Version history, differences, tagged versions and published releases are also
available.
