# CIVL-GAP

This is an experiment to see if I can reproduce the CIVL GAP scoring docs,
starting from LaTeX markup.

Scoring is not simple. Hang-gliding and paragliding are scored similarly but
there are quite a few differences. Over the years scoring has evolved and it is
getting more complex. I'm not sure about this but I expect that only the latest
rules are documented.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository, open a shell and typeset `gap.tex` to produce `gap.pdf`.

```
> git clone https://github.com/BlockScope/CIVL-GAP.git
> cd CIVL-GAP
> xelatex gap.tex
This is XeTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-0.99998 (TeX Live 2017) (preloaded format=xelatex)
...
Output written on gap.pdf (48 pages).
Transcript written on gap.log.
```

I edit the various `*.tex` document fragments in a plain text editor but there
are tools such as [TeXworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeXworks) that are
purpose-built for editing LaTeX and for typsetting and previewing the resultant
`*.pdf`. It runs on Windows, Linux and OSX and is free but requires a separate
TeX installation. For this, I've used
[MiKTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiKTeX) on Windows and
[MacTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacTeX) on OSX. The editing experience
is not [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) with TeXworks, it has
separate windows for editing the source file and for showing the preview.

The whole document can be worked on at once by loading `gap.tex` into the
editor but it is quicker to work on only a section at a time. Each section has
its own `sec-*.tex` file, `sec-introduction.tex` for example. Each appendix is
also self-contained in this way but named `apx-*.tex` such as
`apx-gap-defaults.tex`. Individual sections can be typeset from the command
line too.

```
> xelatex sec-philosophy.tex
This is XeTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-0.99998 (TeX Live 2017) (preloaded format=xelatex)
...
Output written on sec-philosophy.pdf (3 pages).
Transcript written on sec-philosophy.log.
```

Other `*.tex` files contain the LaTeX source for diagrams and graphs.

Note that typesetting the document as a whole must be made twice to create and
then reference labels for sections, figures and tables. On the first pass these
references will be rendered as **??**.

## Why LaTeX?

> LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed
> for the production of technical and scientific documentation. 
>
> LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of
> scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.

LaTeX has markup for equations and charts. Its plain-text source works in well
with source control and related tooling.

There's a [TeX stack exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) question and
answer site. There are abundant learning resources and each package has its own
documentation on CTAN, the Comprehensive TeX Archive. I used the
[pgfplots](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots?lang=en) package for the plots.
I found ShareLaTeX, now [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) helpful.

GAP scoring is well documented.  Currently, the source format is *.docx and it
is published as a single *.pdf file,
[Sporting Code Section 7A - Annex GAP - Edition 2018](https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/civl/documents/sporting_code_s7a-xc-civl_gap_2018.pdf),
running to about fifty pages with very many equations and quite a few charts.

# Proposal for the CIVL Plenary Meeting 2019

There are two proposals:

1. [LaTeX for GAP](/plenary-proposals/latex-gap.md).
2. [Setting the Bar for Scoring
   Software](/plenary-proposals/scoring-software.md).
