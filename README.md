# CIVL-GAP

Not all of the GAP scoring is documented and has many formulae.

As the holes are plugged into the document, as rules are added and errors
corrected it would be good for anyone working on scoring to be able to see past
changes or contribute.

This is an experiment to see if I can reproduce the current document in
LaTeX and then typeset this to PDF.
