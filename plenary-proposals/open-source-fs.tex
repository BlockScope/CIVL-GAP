\section*{Make FS Public}

A proposal for the CIVL Plenary Meeting 2019.

\section*{Problem}

\section*{Solution}
I propose that CIVL make the \href{https://github.com/FAI-CIVL/FS}{FS
repository} public after adding a license of our choosing and that if another
license is not chosen two weeks after the plenary that we'll use the MPL-2.0
license.

\section*{Discussion}
Open source FS:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Would allow other projects to reuse snippets of code from FS.
    \item May attract more contributors.
    \item Allows for more scrutiny.
    \item Is fairer to pilots as nothing is hidden.
    \item Raises the bar for scoring software seeking CIVL approval.
\end{itemize}
