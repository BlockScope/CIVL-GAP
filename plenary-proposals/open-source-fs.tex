\section*{Make FS Public}

A proposal for the CIVL Plenary Meeting 2019 by Phil de Joux.

\section*{Problem}
FS is closed source software and therefore not open to pilot scrutiny.

\section*{Solution}
I propose that CIVL make the \fref{https://github.com/FAI-CIVL/FS}{FS
repository} public after adding a license of our choosing. If a license is not
chosen two weeks after the plenary then we'll use the MPL-2.0 license.

\section*{Discussion}
FS as open source:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Would allow other projects to reuse snippets of code from FS.
    \item May attract more contributors.
    \item Allows for more scrutiny.
    \item Is fairer to pilots as nothing is hidden.
    \item Raises the bar for scoring software seeking CIVL approval.
\end{itemize}
