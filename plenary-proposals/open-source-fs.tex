\title{Make FS Public}
\date{December 3, 2018}
\author{A proposal for the CIVL Plenary Meeting 2019\\\\

\maketitle
\section*{Problem}
FS is closed source software and therefore not open to pilot scrutiny.

\section*{Solution}
I propose that CIVL make the \fref{https://github.com/FAI-CIVL/FS}{FS
repository} public after adding a license of our choosing. If a license is not
chosen two weeks after the plenary then we'll use the MPL-2.0 license.

\section*{Discussion}
FS as open source:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Would allow other projects to reuse snippets of code from FS.
    \item May attract more contributors.
    \item Allows for more scrutiny.
    \item Is fairer to pilots as nothing is hidden.
    \item Raises the bar for scoring software seeking CIVL approval.
    \item Retains CIVL's ability to control distribution of the installer\footnotemark.
\end{itemize}
\footnotetext{Currently the one place to download the installer is from
http://fs.fai.org/. If CIVL made their source code repository at
https://github.com/FAI-CIVL/FS public, then the installer could also be
attached to each release when published. It is an inbuilt security feature of
github that only certain authorised users can cut a release.}
