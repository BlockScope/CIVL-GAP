# Make FS Public

I propose that CIVL make the [FS repository](https://github.com/FAI-CIVL/FS)
public after adding a license of our choosing and that if another license is
not chosen two weeks after the plenary that we'll use the MPL-2.0 license.

Open source FS:

* Would allow other projects to reuse snippets of code from FS.
* May attract more contributors.
* Allows for more scrutiny.
* Is fairer to pilots as nothing is hidden.
* Raises the bar for scoring software seeking CIVL approval.
