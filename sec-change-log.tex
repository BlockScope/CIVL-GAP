A \href{https://github.com/BlockScope/CIVL-GAP/blob/master/changelog.md}{change
log} is still maintained but it is now separate to this document and serves as
a summary of major changes between versions.

\subsection*{Changes from previous edition}
With the change of source for this document to plain text \texttt{*.tex} files,
differences between any number of pairings of versions or revisions can readily
be seen\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{Two examples of differencing the source;
\begin{itemize}
    \item Between tagged versions,
\href{https://github.com/BlockScope/CIVL-GAP/compare/v0.3...v0.4}{comparing
v0.3 to v0.4}
    \item Between a tagged version and the latest commit to the master branch,
\href{https://github.com/BlockScope/CIVL-GAP/compare/v0.1...master}{every
change made since v0.1}.
\end{itemize}
